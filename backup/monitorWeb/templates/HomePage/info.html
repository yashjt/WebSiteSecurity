        <h1>Cyberattack Descriptions</h1>

        <h2>1. Phishing</h2>
        <p>Attackers send fraudulent emails that appear to come from a legitimate source, often containing a link or
            attachment. The email may trick recipients into clicking on the link, which leads to a fake website that
            captures login credentials or other sensitive information. Alternatively, the attachment may contain malware
            that infects the victim's device.</p>

        <h2>2. Ransomware</h2>
        <p>Ransomware is typically delivered through phishing emails or malicious downloads. Once inside a system, it
            encrypts files and demands a ransom payment in exchange for a decryption key. If the ransom is paid, the
            attacker may provide the decryption key, but there's no guarantee of recovering the files.</p>

        <h2>3. DDoS (Distributed Denial of Service)</h2>
        <p>Attackers use a network of compromised devices, known as a botnet, to flood a target website or server with
            an
            overwhelming volume of traffic. The excessive traffic consumes the target's resources, causing it to become
            slow
            or unavailable to legitimate users.</p>

        <h2>4. SQL Injection</h2>
        <p>Attackers exploit vulnerabilities in web application input fields to insert malicious SQL queries. These
            queries
            may manipulate the database, reveal sensitive data, or gain unauthorized access.</p>

        <h2>5. Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)</h2>
        <p>Attackers inject malicious scripts into web pages, often in user-generated content or input fields. When
            other
            users view the page, their browsers execute the injected scripts, potentially stealing cookies or other
            sensitive information.</p>

        <h2>6. Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)</h2>
        <p>Attackers trick users into unknowingly executing malicious actions on a website where they are authenticated.
            This is done by manipulating the victim's web session through various means, such as embedding malicious
            links
            in emails or websites.</p>

        <h2>7. File Upload Vulnerabilities</h2>
        <p>Attackers exploit vulnerabilities in file upload features on websites to upload malicious files. These files
            can
            include scripts or malware, which may execute when accessed by other users.</p>

        <h2>8. Brute Force Attacks</h2>
        <p>Attackers use automated tools to repeatedly guess usernames and passwords until they gain access to an
            account or
            system.</p>

        <h2>9. Credential Stuffing</h2>
        <p>Attackers use stolen username and password combinations from previous breaches on various online accounts.
            They
            rely on individuals reusing passwords across different services, gaining access to accounts with the same
            credentials.</p>

        <h2>10. Malware</h2>
        <p>Malware is often delivered through malicious email attachments, infected downloads, or compromised websites.
            Once
            on a device, malware can perform various malicious activities, including data theft, system compromise, and
            surveillance.</p>

        <h2>11. Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) Attacks</h2>
        <p>Attackers intercept communication between two parties, often by compromising network traffic or devices. This
            allows them to eavesdrop, manipulate data, or steal information exchanged between the parties.</p>

        <h2>12. Zero-Day Exploits</h2>
        <p>Attackers discover and exploit vulnerabilities in software or systems before the vendor releases a patch.
            These
            attacks often target specific software versions or configurations.</p>

        <h2>13. Website Defacement</h2>
        <p>Attackers gain unauthorized access to a website's content management system or server. They modify the
            website's
            appearance or content to display their own message or deface it for various purposes.</p>

        <h2>14. IoT Vulnerabilities</h2>
        <p>Attackers exploit vulnerabilities in Internet of Things (IoT) devices, often through weak default passwords
            or
            unpatched firmware. Compromised devices can be used for various purposes, including launching attacks on
            other
            systems.</p>

        <h2>15. Insider Threats</h2>
        <p>Insider threats involve individuals within an organization misusing their access and privileges. This may
            include
            stealing data, sharing sensitive information, or intentionally causing harm.</p>

        <h2>16. Cryptojacking</h2>
        <p>Attackers use malicious scripts or malware to hijack a victim's device's processing power to mine
            cryptocurrencies without their consent or knowledge.</p>

        <h2>17. Advanced Persistent Threats (APTs)</h2>
        <p>APTs are typically carried out by well-funded, persistent attackers with specific objectives. These attackers
            use
            a variety of tactics, such as spear-phishing, zero-day exploits, and long-term reconnaissance, to infiltrate
            and
            maintain access to target networks.</p>

        <p>Understanding how these cyberattacks are executed is crucial for organizations and individuals to take
            proactive
            measures to prevent or mitigate them. Additionally, staying informed about emerging threats and employing
            robust
            cybersecurity practices is essential for safeguarding digital assets and data.</p>
